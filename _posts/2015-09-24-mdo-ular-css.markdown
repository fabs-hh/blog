This morning I found this interesting talk about rules you should take in account when writing CSS.

Mark Otto talks about problems with nesting css and gives a better approach.
He explains problems with the usage of Sass and the @extend operator and why he is trying to avoid using it.
 
He also shows why grouping definitions by type are probably a good idea, e.g.:
First positioning comes than box model than typography ...and so on... 

If you are interesting watch his talk (~ 30 minutes):
